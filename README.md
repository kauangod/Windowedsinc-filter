In this lab, conducted in the Linear Systems Analysis course at the Federal University of Technology – Paraná, my partner Pedro Henrique Chagas Fallgatter and I tackled a practical image processing challenge.

The goal of the lab was to separate the faces of Albert Einstein and Marilyn Monroe from a combined image by analyzing their frequency components. The task involved applying techniques to distinguish and extract different frequency components in the image, thereby isolating the facial features of each individual.
